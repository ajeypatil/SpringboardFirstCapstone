Airport Performance Analysis

By Ajey Patil 

Introduction

The Objective of this project is to analyze
Flight Delay and Cancellations per Airport.

The Problem

When multiple airports are available in metro area, then residents of metro area
have choice of airport for boarding a flight. An analysis of airport performance
in terms of flight delay and cancellation is required for passengers to choose
an airport with highest performance.

The Client

The main clients for this analysis are:

    Airport Passengers: this analysis will help them choose airport in vicinity
    depending on airport performance of flight delays and cancellations 

    Airport management: this report will help them determine systemic and process
    related issues affecting flight delays and cancellations 

    Airline management: this report will help them determine best performing
    airports in terms of flight delays and canceellations and their reasons
    in scheduling and flight route planning.

    Regulatory boards: this analysis will assist in identifying consistenly
    low performing airports in terms of flight cancellations and delays and 
    their reasons 

The Data

The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics 
tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. 
Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights 
is published in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and in this dataset of 
2015 flight delays and cancellations.

The Approach

The following steps highlight the strategy to be adopted for carrying 
out the analysis for the Capstone project:

    Data Wrangling and Cleaning
        Deal with missing values: Use domain information to determine 
        if missing values should be discarded
        Dropping columns that are irrelevant to the analysis
        Rearrange and transform dataset for cleaner analysis.

    Exploratory Data Analysis
        Perform Regression Analysis to determine factors that most influence the
        flight cancellations and delays 
        Identify patterns and correlation between the different variables
        Use data visualization for graphical analysis to answer questions on the dataset

    Predictive Analysis
        Apply machine learning techniques to see if the flight delay or cancellation
        can be predicted 

The Deliverables

The deliverables for this project will include a report of all the findings, 
a slide deck and python code, all of which will be published on GitHub.

Specific questions to be explored

1. What is co-relation between airport and day of week of flight that got cancelled ?

2. What is co-relation between airport and day of week of flight that got delayed ?

3. What is co-relation between delay time and airport and day of week ?

4. What is co-relation between diverted flights and airport and day of week

5. Categorize the delay reason for flights at airport and numbers of delays per delay reason

6. Based on number of delays per delay reason and number of delays per day of week, predict best airport for minimum flight delay and cancellations.
